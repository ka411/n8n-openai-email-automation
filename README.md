# n8n-openai-email-automation
This project implements a smart, automated email response system using n8n workflow automation and OpenAI's GPT model. It classifies incoming Gmail messages such as Job Applications, Sponsorship Requests, and Irrelevant Emails, and then sends tailored replies based on the detected category.

This repository aims to continuously enhance the email classification accuracy and response quality by refining workflows, improving prompt engineering, and expanding category coverage based on real-world use cases.
