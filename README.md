n8n-OpenAI Email Automation — Project Summary
This project is a production-minded workflow that turns your inbox into a smart, polite, and fast-responding assistant. Built on n8n for orchestration and OpenAI for language understanding, it automatically reads incoming Gmail messages, classifies them (e.g., Job Applications, Sponsorship Requests, Irrelevant/Other), and sends a tailored reply—while logging what happened and giving you control over edge cases.

What it does (at a glance)
Ingests email from Gmail in near-real time (via n8n Gmail Trigger).

Understands intent using an OpenAI GPT prompt that’s optimized for short, noisy emails.

Maps intent → action: chooses the right reply template, pulls in merge fields, and sends a response.

Keeps records: stores classifications, confidence, and email metadata (e.g., in Google Sheets/Notion/DB).

Improves over time: you can refine prompts, templates, and categories based on real conversations.

Why this is useful
Speed: Every sender gets a timely, relevant reply—even outside office hours.

Consistency: Standardized tone and content for sensitive flows (e.g., hiring).

Focus: Humans review only low-confidence or high-impact messages, not the long tail of routine emails.

Learning loop: Misclassifications are fed back into the system to improve prompt quality and rules.

Core workflow (end-to-end)
Trigger & Fetch

n8n’s Gmail Trigger node picks up new messages (subject, body, sender, attachments).

Pre-cleaning

Optional text cleanup: strip signatures/footers, collapse quoted threads, extract attachments/meta.

Classification (OpenAI)

Prompt instructs GPT to choose one label from a controlled set (e.g., job_application | sponsorship | irrelevant | escalation_needed) and return structured JSON with:

category

confidence (0–1)

key_points (bullet summary)

required_fields (e.g., missing resume, missing budget)

Decision Logic

If confidence ≥ threshold → proceed automatically.

If confidence < threshold or category = escalation_needed → route to Human-in-the-Loop review (e.g., Slack notification or a Google Form queue).

Template Selection & Personalization

Pick a reply template by category (markdown or HTML).

Fill merge tags (sender name, role, event, deadline).

Optionally ask GPT to polish tone while preserving template content.

Send Reply

Send via Gmail node.

Apply Gmail label (e.g., auto/answered/job-application).

Logging & Analytics

Write an entry (timestamp, sender, category, confidence, message id, outcome) to Google Sheets/DB.

Optional: store the prompt/response pair for future evaluation (PII-safe).

Continuous Improvement

A separate n8n workflow periodically reviews misclassifications and low-confidence cases to update:

the category list and examples,

the few-shot prompt examples,

reply templates and fallback copy.

Categories & replies (initial set)
Job Applications: Thank the candidate, confirm receipt, share timeline, and request any missing docs (CV, portfolio, availability).

Sponsorship Requests: Acknowledge, outline criteria (audience size, budget, dates), and provide a short next-steps form or link.

Irrelevant / Unqualified: Polite decline or redirect.

Escalation Needed: Edge cases (legal, VIP, media) routed to a human with a structured summary.

You can add categories like Sales Inquiry, Customer Support, Partnership, and Invoice/Billing with their own templates and owners.
